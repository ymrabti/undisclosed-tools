When creating variable names, developers often follow naming conventions and patterns to make their code more readable and maintainable. Here are some common naming patterns for variables:

1. **Camel Case**: In this pattern, variable names start with a lowercase letter and each subsequent word begins with an uppercase letter. Example: `myVariableName`.

2. **Pascal Case**: Similar to Camel Case, but the first letter of each word is capitalized. Pascal Case is often used for class names and type names. Example: `MyClassName`.

3. **Snake Case**: Variable names are written in lowercase letters, and words are separated by underscores. Example: `my_variable_name`.

4. **Hungarian Notation**: A naming convention where variable names include a prefix that indicates the variable's data type. For example, "str" for strings, "int" for integers, or "bool" for booleans. Example: `strName`, `intCount`, `boolIsValid`.

5. **Kebab Case**: Variable names are in all lowercase letters, and words are separated by hyphens. Example: `my-variable-name`.

6. **Screaming Snake Case**: Similar to snake case, but words are separated by underscores, and all letters are uppercase. Example: `MY_CONSTANT_VALUE`.

7. **UPPERCASE**: Variable names are written in all capital letters, and words are separated by underscores. Typically used for constants. Example: `MAX_VALUE`.

8. **CamelBack**: This pattern is similar to Camel Case, but it doesn't use any delimiters between words. It capitalizes the first letter of the first word and leaves subsequent words lowercase. Example: `myVariableName`.

9. **dromedaryCase**: Similar to Camel Case but uses a lowercase letter for the first word and uppercase letters for subsequent words. Example: `myVariableName`.

10. **LISP Case**: Variable names are written in all lowercase letters, and words are separated by hyphens. Example: `my-variable-name`.

11. **Train Case**: Similar to Kebab Case but uses capital letters to start each word. Example: `My-Variable-Name`.

12. **Case Insensitive**: Variable names are not case-sensitive, and you can use any combination of letters without regard to the case. Example: `myvariablename`.

It's important to follow the naming conventions and patterns recommended by the programming language and community you're working in to maintain consistency in your code. The choice of naming pattern can also depend on the specific coding standards of your project or team.
